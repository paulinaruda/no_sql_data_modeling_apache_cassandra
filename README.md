# Purpose of this project

This project showcases my skills in data modeling for NoSQL database, Apache Cassandra. 

NoSQL databases, also known as "non-relational" databases, are a type of database management system that differ from traditional relational databases. They are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, making them a popular choice for big data applications and real-time web applications. 
Cassandra is a distributed and highly scalable NoSQL database that is designed to handle large amounts of data across multiple commodity servers. It offers high availability, fault tolerance, and linear scalability, making it suitable for applications that require high performance and fault tolerance, such as social media platforms and IoT applications.
